            <strong>Purpose:</strong> To enable students to describe and explain the structure and function of enzymes, as well as the kinetics and mechanisms of enzyme-catalysed reactions. The knowledge acquired will enable students to recognise the relevance of enzymes in living systems and how the characteristics of enzymes are used in numerous life sciences and biotechnical applications.
